# my_focus_app

Focus/Pomodoro app specifically for me

## Fix

[] end session button which stops the foreground service
[] don't start the task if already running and the app opens again
[] Ignore battery optimization not working
[] Open/start brain.fm?
[] custom notification for service
    - apparently flutter_foreground_task doesn't allow for it. If I want it later, 
        I would need to find another lib or implement it myself
[x] Service not running
[x] service notification not showing
- don't start service until notification request is accepted
- move to home page

## TODOs
[] Android Foreground activity
    [] Can manually implement it later
[] iOS Live Activity
